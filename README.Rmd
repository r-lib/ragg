This package provides graphic devices for R based on the AGG library developed
by the late Maxim Shemanarev. AGG provides both higher performance and higher
quality than the standard raster devices provided by grDevices. For a comparison
with the default devices, see the
[performance](https://ragg.r-lib.org/articles/ragg_performance.html) and
[quality](https://ragg.r-lib.org/articles/ragg_quality.html) vignettes.

## Installation
The package can be installed from CRAN with `install.packages('ragg')` or, if 
the development version is desired, directly from github:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages('pak')
pak::pak('r-lib/ragg')
```

## Use
ragg provides drop-in replacements for the png, jpeg, and tiff graphic devices
provided by default from the grDevices packages and can both produce png, jpeg 
and tiff files. Notable features, that sets itself apart from the build-in
devices, includes:

- Faster (up to 40% faster than anti-aliased cairo device)
- Direct access to all system fonts
- Advanced text rendering, including support for right-to-left text, emojis, and
  font fallback
- High quality anti-aliasing
- High quality rotated text
- Support 16-bit output
- System independent rendering (output from Mac, Windows, and Linux should be
  identical)

You can use it like any other device. The main functions are `agg_png()`,
`agg_jpeg()` and `agg_tiff()`, all of which have arguments that closely match 
those of the `png()`, `jpeg()` and `tiff()` functions, so switching over should 
be easy.

```{r, fig.alt="A scatterplot created with ggplot2 using a fancy non-standard font and mixing in emojis with text"}
library(ragg)
library(ggplot2)

file <- knitr::fig_path('.png')

on_linux <- tolower(Sys.info()[['sysname']]) == 'linux'
fancy_font <- if (on_linux) 'URW Chancery L' else 'Papyrus'

agg_png(file, width = 1000, height = 500, res = 144)
ggplot(mtcars) + 
  geom_point(aes(mpg, disp, colour = hp)) + 
  labs(title = 'System fonts — Oh My! 😱') + 
  theme(text = element_text(family = fancy_font))
invisible(dev.off())

knitr::include_graphics(file)
```

Further, it provides an `agg_capture()` device that lets you access the device
buffer directly from your R session.

```{r, fig.asp=0.5, out.width="70%", out.extra='style="margin-left: 15%;"', fig.alt="A very simple scatterplot captured as raster data and then drawn again"}
cap <- agg_capture(width = 1000, height = 500, res = 144)
plot(1:10, 1:10)

scatter <- cap()
invisible(dev.off())

# Remove margins from raster plotting
par(mai = c(0, 0, 0, 0))
plot(as.raster(scatter))
```

### Use ragg with knitr
knitr supports png output from ragg by setting `dev = "ragg_png"` in the chunk
settings or globally with `knitr::opts_chunk$set(dev = "ragg_png")`.

### Use ragg in RStudio
ragg can be used as the graphic back-end to the RStudio device 
(for RStudio >= 1.4) by choosing *AGG* as the backend in the graphics pane in 
general options (see screenshot)

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Setting ragg as backend in RStudio", fig.alt="A screenshot showing the RStudio Global Options window with focus on the General pane and the Graphics tab. Here it shows AGG is selected as Backend in order to tell RStudio to use ragg"}
